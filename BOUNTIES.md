# EasyGitian Funding


Gitian is an excellent package to build cryptocurrency (and other) 
software, but it's not easy, even for many developers. EasyGitian 
was made to serve my own purposes, and has grown into something that 
hopefully provides some benefit to the rest of the crypto community.

Every build, whether for testing or production takes time and costs money

Living off the grid, I'm very sensitive to how many watts are burned in the
course of running each build, the costs of being online for each build, and 
the costs in time and bandwidth to repeat steps for the myriad reasons each build 
might fail. 

There's always room to improve, and always more coins and applications to support. 

Today EasyGitian will help you build most bitcoin derived wallet packages, up to
BitcoinCore version 0.14.x and Bitcoin-ABC version 0.14.6. It was developed against

Bitcoin-ABC 0.14.6
PIVX 3.0.0
MAZA 0.10.3 0.10.2
DASH 0.13.0

If your coin follows the patters for gitian descriptors and repos that are followed by those 
coins, you should have no trouble building with EasyGitian. 

If not, I'm always happy to help 

## The Funding Part

If EasyGitian has helped you or your team, you can show your appreciation by:

 - Tweeting the link to the github repo
 - Buying me a beer
   In person, or you can send some (maybe even some you made!) 
 - Sending cold hard Cash!
   Everyone likes cash, especially my generator. It takes almost any kind of crypto you have
   See below for addresses that I've already prepared. 

If you'd like EasyGitian to work with your coin, I'm happy to add it. You pay gas ;) 
It takes a few hours to build a full set of dependencies on my 2010 core i7 Macbook
in Linux or MacOS, which is about a tankful on my generator, and it takes a few builds 
before everything is right. 

On the roadmap for this project is the ability to use other Vagrant "providers". Virtualbox is 
but one possible "provider" of the underlying Virtual Machine. Vagrant plugins are available for most
major VPS providers, including Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, and more. These cost not only time (gas), but 
the VPS provider needs some too. 

aws azure bhyve brightbox cloudstack
digitalocean ganeti google hp joyent
linode libvirt lxc openstack openstack-provider
openvz parallels proxmox rackspace scaleway
skytap softlayer vcenter vcloud vcloudair
veertu vmware-appcatalyst vmware-esxi vsphere vultr

For docker fans, there's [gitian-docker](https://github.com/mazacoin/gitian-docker)
 - my development of docker tools has slowed due to the difficulty of keeping pace with 
   upstream Docker development, and breaking changes. If you'd like to see updates to 
   gitian-docker or any of my other docker tools, please contact me on Twitter or Telegram (@guruvan)

# WAIT, JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
