Gitian building, and EasyGitian are somewhat complex with 
host, VM, lxx build VM, gitian-builder, and your gitian descriptors and coin repos

## VM Errors
 - EasyGitian command run
 
 - Does the VM appear start up?
 
 - Can you login via ```vagrant ssh```
 
 - If Virtuablx, does the VM's window open (N/A if toggled off) 
 
 - Post a snippet of the falure from the host
 
 
## Build Errors
 
 - Did the build actually start and fail, or fail to start
   (look for ./bin/gbuild errors in your console)
 
 - Host output snippet
 
 - If you were watching the install or build logs DURING the build, post a snippet
